## Summary:

Both June and December temperatures do not seem like they would hinder sales for the surf/icecream shop. Though on opposite sides of the calendar year, becasue Oahu is tropical there is not much variation in the temperatures.
Some improvements can be made to this analysis:
1. Look at the temperature by year to make sure all the data is free from outliers or if there is a trend that might need to be taken into consideration.
ex. If the looking at the temps on a yearly basis, it might be found that december is progressively getting colder and therefore may not be a viable to have the shop stay open in Decembers of the coming years.
2. It would also be smart to compare weather data of June and December with other months. The coldest month may not be December and the warmest month may not be June. This information is assumed in the analysis, but that is not always the case.
